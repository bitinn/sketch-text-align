sketch-text-align
=================

Properly align text layers regardless of their rectangle box in Sketch


# Motivation

Because Sketch v3.x still has less than ideal support for font-size and line-height, especially when you are dealing with CJK language (Some say it's a limit of OS X). This plugin allow you to align text as imagined, ignoring those incorrectly calculated text rectangles.


# Install

1. Download ZIP of this repo
2. Extract
3. Put the folder in your Sketch plugin folder (Use `Plugins>Reveal Plugins Folder` to find it)

Folder name and plugin filename will show up in Sketch `Plugins` menu.


# Usage

1. Select multiple text layers
2. Alt + Cmd + L or `Plugins` menu
3. Follow the dialog prompt
